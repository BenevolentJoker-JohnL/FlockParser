{"text": "Medieval Period\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, flat Earth theories experienced a resurgence in\n\nEurope. The Catholic Church played a significant role in promoting a flat\n\nEarth, with some theologians arguing that a spherical earth contradicted\n\nbiblical descriptions of creation (Flat Earth and the Bible). This led to the\n\ndevelopment of various flat Earth models, including the \"Tychonic system,\"\n\nwhich placed the Sun and Moon on a series of crystal spheres above a\n\nstationary flat earth.", "embedding": []}
