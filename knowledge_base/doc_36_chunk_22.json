{"text": "Regulation in Individuals with Bipolar Disorder\n\nResearch has shown that hormonal changes can significantly affect individuals\n\nwith bipolar disorder. A study published in the Journal of Clinical\n\nPsychopharmacology found that hormonal fluctuations, particularly those\n\nexperienced during menstruation or menopause, can trigger mood swings in\n\npeople with a history of bipolar disorder (1). This is because the hormonal\n\nchanges can alter the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to\n\nmood disturbances.", "embedding": []}
