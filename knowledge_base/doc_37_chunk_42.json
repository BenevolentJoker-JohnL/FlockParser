{"text": "Mechanisms Underlying Weight-Related Changes\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the weight-related\n\nchanges in antipsychotic pharmacodynamics. These include:\n\n   \u2022 Increased body fat leading to higher drug concentrations\n\n   \u2022 Altered metabolism and clearance of drugs in obese individuals\n\n   \u2022 Changes in brain chemistry and function associated with obesity\n\nThese mechanisms may contribute to the observed differences in antipsychotic\n\nefficacy between obese and non-obese patients.", "embedding": []}
