# Interactions between
Antipsychotics, Trazodone, and
Birth Control: A Comprehensive
Review
As of August 05, 2024, antipsychotic medications are commonly used to treat
various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
However, their use can be complicated by interactions with other medications,
such as trazodone (an antidepressant) and birth control pills.
Trazodone is often prescribed off-label for insomnia and anxiety, which may
co-occur with psychiatric conditions. Meanwhile, birth control pills are used to
prevent pregnancy in women of childbearing age. The concomitant use of
these medications with antipsychotics can lead to significant interactions,
including:
• Increased risk of serotonin syndrome 1
• Enhanced sedative effects
• Potential changes in blood pressure and heart rate
Given the complexity of these interactions, it is essential for healthcare
providers to be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions
when prescribing antipsychotics, trazodone, and birth control pills together.
This report aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current literature
on this topic, highlighting the key findings and recommendations for safe and
effective use.

Antipsychotic Interactions
Overview of Antipsychotic Medications
Antipsychotic medications are primarily used to treat psychotic symptoms
associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions. These
medications work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the brain,
particularly dopamine and serotonin. There are several classes of
antipsychotics, including first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, second-
generation (atypical) antipsychotics, and third-generation antipsychotics.
Interactions between Antipsychotics and Trazodone
Trazodone is a medication used to treat depression. It works by increasing the
levels of serotonin in the brain. When trazodone is combined with
antipsychotic medications, it can increase the risk of adverse effects such as
dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in blood pressure.
• Serotonin syndrome: The combination of trazodone and certain
antipsychotics, such as risperidone or quetiapine, may increase the risk
of serotonin syndrome. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that
occurs when there are too many serotonin receptors activated in the
brain.
• Orthostatic hypotension: The combination of trazodone and certain
antipsychotics, such as olanzapine or quetiapine, may increase the risk of
orthostatic hypotension. This is a condition that occurs when there is a
sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing.
Interactions between Antipsychotics and Birth Control
Birth control medications work by altering hormone levels in the body to
prevent pregnancy. When birth control medications are combined with
antipsychotic medications, it can increase the risk of adverse effects such as
changes in menstrual cycle, mood changes, and increased risk of blood clots.
• Increased risk of blood clots: The combination of birth control
medications and certain antipsychotics, such as olanzapine or quetiapine,
may increase the risk of blood clots. This is a potentially life-threatening
condition that occurs when there are blood clots in the veins.
• Changes in menstrual cycle: The combination of birth control
medications and certain antipsychotics, such as risperidone or
quetiapine, may cause changes in menstrual cycle. This can include
irregular periods, heavy bleeding, or spotting.
Interactions between Antipsychotics
When two or more antipsychotic medications are combined, it can increase
the risk of adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in blood
pressure.
• Increased risk of adverse effects: The combination of two or more
antipsychotic medications may increase the risk of adverse effects. This is
because each medication can have its own set of side effects, and
combining them can increase the risk of these side effects.
• Changes in blood pressure: The combination of certain antipsychotics,
such as olanzapine or quetiapine, may cause changes in blood pressure.
This can include high blood pressure or low blood pressure.
Conclusion
The interactions between antipsychotic medications and other medications,
such as trazodone and birth control, can increase the risk of adverse effects. It
is essential to discuss these potential interactions with a healthcare provider
before starting any new medication.
Interactions between Antipsychotics,
Trazadone, and Birth Control
Overview of Antipsychotic-Trazadone Interactions
The combination of trazodone with antipsychotic medications can increase the
risk of adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in blood
pressure. (1)
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs
when there are too many serotonin receptors activated in the brain. The
combination of trazodone and certain antipsychotics, such as risperidone or
quetiapine, may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. (2)
Orthostatic hypotension is a condition that occurs when there is a sudden drop
in blood pressure upon standing. The combination of trazodone and certain
antipsychotics, such as olanzapine or quetiapine, may increase the risk of
orthostatic hypotension. (3)
Interactions between Antipsychotics and Birth Control
Birth control medications work by altering hormone levels in the body to
prevent pregnancy. When birth control medications are combined with
antipsychotic medications, it can increase the risk of adverse effects such as
changes in menstrual cycle, mood changes, and increased risk of blood clots.
The combination of birth control medications and certain antipsychotics, such
as olanzapine or quetiapine, may increase the risk of blood clots. This is a
potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when there are blood clots in
the veins. (4)
Changes in menstrual cycle can also occur when birth control medications and
certain antipsychotics, such as risperidone or quetiapine, are combined. This
can include irregular periods, heavy bleeding, or spotting. (5)
Interactions between Trazadone and Birth Control
The combination of trazodone with birth control medications may increase the
risk of adverse effects such as changes in menstrual cycle, mood changes, and
increased risk of blood clots.
While the previous section discussed interactions between antipsychotics and
birth control, this section will explore interactions between trazodone and
birth control. The combination of trazodone with birth control medications
may increase the risk of adverse effects such as changes in menstrual cycle,
mood changes, and increased risk of blood clots. (6)
Interactions between Antipsychotics, Trazadone, and Birth
Control
The combination of antipsychotic medications, trazodone, and birth control
medications can increase the risk of adverse effects such as changes in
menstrual cycle, mood changes, increased risk of blood clots, and orthostatic
hypotension.
While the previous sections discussed interactions between antipsychotics and
trazodone, antipsychotics and birth control, and trazodone and birth control,
this section will explore interactions between all three. The combination of
antipsychotic medications, trazodone, and birth control medications can
increase the risk of adverse effects such as changes in menstrual cycle, mood
changes, increased risk of blood clots, and orthostatic hypotension. (7)
