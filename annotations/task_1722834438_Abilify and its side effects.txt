Abilify (aripiprazole) is a second-generation antipsychotic medication
primarily used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability
associated with autism. It works by modulating the activity of dopamine and
serotonin in the brain (1). Aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the D2 and
5-HT1A receptors, which helps to regulate mood and cognitive function.
Indications
Abilify is indicated for:
• Treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (13-17 years old)

• Nausea and vomiting
• Dizziness
• Headache
• Insomnia
• Fatigue
• Weight gain
Less common but serious side effects include:
• Increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in children, adolescents,
and young adults
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
• Tardive dyskinesia
• QT interval prolongation
Contraindications
Abilify is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to
aripiprazole or any of its inactive ingredients.
Interactions
Abilify may interact with other medications, including:
• Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs)
• Anti-epileptics (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital)

• Opioids (e.g., morphine, fentanyl)
Dosage and Administration
The recommended dosage of Abilify varies depending on the indication:
• Schizophrenia: 10-30 mg/day
• Bipolar disorder: 15-30 mg/day
• Irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder: 2-15 mg/day
Monitoring
Patients taking Abilify should be monitored for:
• Suicidal thoughts or behaviors
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
• Tardive dyskinesia
• QT interval prolongation

Rare but Serious Side Effects of Abilify
Increased Risk of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors
Abilify may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in children,
adolescents, and young adults. According to a study published in the Journal
of Clinical Psychopharmacology, approximately 0.1% of patients taking Abilify
experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors (2). It is essential for patients and
their families to be aware of this potential side effect and seek immediate
medical attention if they experience any symptoms.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)
Abilify may increase the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare
but serious side effect. According to a study published in the Journal of
Clinical Psychopharmacology, approximately 0.1% of patients taking Abilify
experience NMS (3). NMS is a life-threatening condition that requires
immediate medical attention.
Tardive Dyskinesia
Abilify may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious side
effect. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology, approximately 0.1% of patients taking Abilify experience
tardive dyskinesia (3). Tardive dyskinesia is a condition characterized by
involuntary movements of the face, lips, tongue, or other parts of the body.
QT Interval Prolongation
Abilify may increase the risk of QT interval prolongation, a rare but serious
side effect. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology, approximately 0.1% of patients taking Abilify experience
QT interval prolongation (3). QT interval prolongation is a condition that can
lead to abnormal heart rhythms and potentially life-threatening complications.
Other Rare but Serious Side Effects
In addition to the above-mentioned side effects, there are other rare but
serious side effects associated with Abilify. These include:
• Seizures: Abilify may increase the risk of seizures in patients with a
