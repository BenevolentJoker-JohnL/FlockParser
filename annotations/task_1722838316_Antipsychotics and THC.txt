Antipsychotics and THC: A Comprehensive Review
Abstract The use of antipsychotics in conjunction with tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), a psychoactive compound found in cannabis, has been a topic of
interest in recent years. This report aims to provide an in-depth review of the
current literature on this subject, exploring the potential interactions and
effects of combining these substances.
Introduction Antipsychotics are a class of medications used to treat
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major
depressive disorder (1). THC, on the other hand, is a primary psychoactive
compound found in cannabis, which has been used for medicinal and
recreational purposes (2).
Pharmacological Interactions The combination of antipsychotics with THC
can lead to complex pharmacological interactions. Antipsychotics, particularly
first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, have been shown to interact with the
cannabinoid system (3). These interactions may result in altered effects of
both substances.
Clinical Studies Several clinical studies have investigated the use of
antipsychotics in conjunction with THC. A study published in the Journal of
Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the combination of olanzapine (an
atypical antipsychotic) and THC resulted in improved symptoms of
schizophrenia (4).
Another study published in the Journal of Cannabis Research found that the
use of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis, in
combination with antipsychotics resulted in reduced symptoms of anxiety and
depression (5).
Mechanisms of Action The mechanisms by which antipsychotics interact
with THC are not fully understood. However, research suggests that the
cannabinoid system plays a role in modulating the effects of antipsychotics (6).
Conclusion In conclusion, the use of antipsychotics in conjunction with THC
has been shown to have potential therapeutic benefits. However, further
research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action and to
determine the optimal dosing regimens for these substances.
Recommendations
• Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of combining
antipsychotics with THC on psychiatric symptoms.
• Research should focus on determining the optimal dosing regimens for
these substances.
• The mechanisms by which antipsychotics interact with THC should be
further investigated.
