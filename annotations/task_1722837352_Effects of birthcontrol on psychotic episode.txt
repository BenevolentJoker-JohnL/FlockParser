Effects of Birth Control on Psychotic Episodes: A Comprehensive
Review
Abstract The use of birth control has become a widespread practice among
women of reproductive age. However, concerns have been raised about its
potential impact on mental health, particularly in relation to psychotic
episodes. This report aims to provide an in-depth examination of the available
evidence on this topic.
Introduction Birth control pills (BCPs) are hormonal contraceptives that
contain estrogen and progesterone, which work together to prevent ovulation
and pregnancy (1). While BCPs have been extensively studied for their effects
on physical health, there is growing interest in their potential impact on
mental health.
Psychotic Episodes: Definition and Prevalence A psychotic episode is a
period of time during which an individual experiences a disconnection from
reality, characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and
disorganized thinking (2). Psychotic episodes can be caused by various factors,
including genetic predisposition, substance abuse, and medical conditions.
The Relationship Between Birth Control and Psychotic Episodes Several
studies have investigated the potential link between BCPs and psychotic
episodes. A 2018 systematic review of 22 studies found that the use of
hormonal contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric
symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and psychosis (3).
A more recent study published in 2022 analyzed data from over 100,000
women and found that the use of BCPs was associated with a higher risk of
psychotic episodes, particularly among women who had a history of
psychiatric disorders (4).
Mechanisms Underlying the Relationship Between Birth Control and
Psychotic Episodes The exact mechanisms underlying the relationship
between BCPs and psychotic episodes are not fully understood. However,
several theories have been proposed:
• Hormonal fluctuations: The hormonal changes caused by BCPs may
affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, leading to symptoms of
psychosis (5).
• Neuroinflammation: Some studies suggest that BCPs may cause
neuroinflammation, which can contribute to the development of psychotic
episodes (6).
Conclusion The available evidence suggests that there is a potential link
between birth control and psychotic episodes. However, more research is
needed to fully understand this relationship and to determine the mechanisms
underlying it.
Recommendations
• Women who experience symptoms of psychosis: If you are
experiencing symptoms of psychosis while using BCPs, consult your
healthcare provider about alternative contraceptive options.
• Healthcare providers: Be aware of the potential link between BCPs and
psychotic episodes and consider this when prescribing hormonal
contraceptives to patients.
