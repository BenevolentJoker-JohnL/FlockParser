E ects on Weight in Bipolar
Disorder
Abstract
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex mental health condition characterized by
extreme mood swings, ranging rom manic highs to depressive lows. While the
primary ocus o BD research has been on its psychological and emotional
aspects, recent studies have highlighted the signifcant impact o the disorder
on physical health, particularly weight management. This report aims to
provide an in-depth examination o the eects o bipolar disorder on weight,
exploring the underlying mechanisms, treatment options, and liestyle
considerations.
Introduction
Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition aecting approximately 2.6% o the
global population (1). The disorder's impact on mental health is well-
documented; however, its eects on physical health, particularly weight
management, have only recently gained attention.
Weight Changes in Bipolar Disorder
Research has consistently shown that individuals with bipolar disorder
experience signifcant weight changes throughout the course o their illness. A
study published in the Journal o Clinical Psychopharmacology ound that 71%
o participants with BD experienced weight gain during manic episodes (2).
Conversely, depressive episodes were associated with weight loss in
approximately 55% o participants.
Mechanisms Underlying Weight Changes
Several actors contribute to the weight changes observed in individuals with
bipolar disorder:
• Hormonal fuctuations: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
is activated during manic episodes, leading to increased cortisol levels.
Elevated cortisol promotes at storage and redistribution (3).
• Medication side eects: Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers commonly
used in BD treatment can cause weight gain due to their metabolic
eects (4).
• Liestyle actors: Poor sleep habits, decreased physical activity, and
unhealthy eating patterns are common among individuals with BD,
contributing to weight changes (5).
Treatment Options
While there is no specifc treatment or weight-related issues in bipolar
disorder, several strategies can help manage weight:
• Medication adjustments: Switching rom antipsychotics to mood
stabilizers or adjusting medication dosages may help mitigate weight
gain (6).
• Liestyle modications: Encouraging regular physical activity, healthy
eating habits, and stress management techniques can help individuals
with BD maintain a healthy weight (7).
Conclusion
Bipolar disorder has a signifcant impact on an individual's physical health,
particularly weight management. Understanding the underlying mechanisms,
treatment options, and liestyle considerations can help individuals with BD
manage their weight-related issues eectively. Further research is needed to
develop targeted interventions or weight management in BD.
