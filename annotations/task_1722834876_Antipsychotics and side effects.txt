# Antipsychotics and Side Effects:
A Comprehensive Review
Introduction
Antipsychotic medications are a crucial treatment option for individuals with
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other
psychiatric conditions. These medications work by altering the levels of
neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, to help
manage symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking
(National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)). However, like all medications,
antipsychotics can cause a range of side effects, some of which can be severe.
Purpose
This report aims to provide an in-depth examination of the side effects
associated with antipsychotic medications. It will cover various aspects,
including:
• Common and rare side effects
• Side effect profiles for different classes of antipsychotics (e.g., first-
generation, second-generation)
• Factors that influence the risk of experiencing side effects (e.g., age,
dosage, comorbidities)
• Strategies for mitigating or managing side effects
Scope and Limitations
This report will focus on the side effects of antipsychotic medications in
adults. The scope does not include pediatric populations or specific conditions
like Parkinson's disease, where antipsychotics may be used off-label.
Methodology
The information presented in this report is based on a comprehensive review
of existing literature, including peer-reviewed articles, clinical trials, and
reputable sources (e.g., MedlinePlus, Psychiatry Online).

Common Antipsychotic Side Effects
Overview
Antipsychotics are a class of medications used to treat psychiatric conditions
such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. While
effective in managing symptoms, antipsychotics can cause various side effects,
some of which can be severe. This section will discuss the common
antipsychotic side effects.
1. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)
Definition
Extrapyramidal symptoms are a group of movement disorders that can occur
as a result of antipsychotic medication use. These symptoms include:
• Akathisia: A feeling of restlessness and agitation.
• Dystonia: Involuntary muscle contractions, leading to abnormal
postures.
• Parkinsonism: Symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, such as tremors
and stiffness.
Prevalence
According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/), EPS occur in
approximately 20-30% of patients taking antipsychotics.
Management
To manage EPS, healthcare providers may adjust the dosage or switch to a
different antipsychotic medication. In some cases, medications like benzhexol
(Cogentin) can be used to alleviate symptoms.
2. Metabolic Changes
Definition
Antipsychotics can cause changes in metabolism, leading to weight gain and
increased risk of developing conditions such as:
• Type 2 diabetes: High blood sugar levels.
• Dyslipidemia: Abnormal lipid profiles.
Prevalence
A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/) found that approximately
10-20% of patients taking antipsychotics experience metabolic changes.
Management
To manage metabolic changes, healthcare providers may recommend lifestyle
modifications such as a healthy diet and regular exercise. In some cases,
medications like metformin (Glucophage) can be used to improve insulin
sensitivity.
3. Sedation and Drowsiness
Definition
Antipsychotics can cause sedation and drowsiness, especially during the initial
stages of treatment.
Prevalence
According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/), sedation and
drowsiness occur in approximately 10-20% of patients taking antipsychotics.
Management
To manage sedation and drowsiness, healthcare providers may adjust the
dosage or switch to a different antipsychotic medication. In some cases,
medications like modafinil (Provigil) can be used to improve alertness.
4. Sexual Dysfunction
Definition
Antipsychotics can cause sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido and
erectile dysfunction.
Prevalence
A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/) found that approximately
10-20% of patients taking antipsychotics experience sexual dysfunction.
Management
To manage sexual dysfunction, healthcare providers may recommend lifestyle
modifications such as a healthy diet and regular exercise. In some cases,
medications like sildenafil (Viagra) can be used to improve erectile function.
5. Cardiovascular Effects
Definition
Antipsychotics can cause cardiovascular effects, including increased heart
rate and blood pressure.
Prevalence
According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/), cardiovascular
effects occur in approximately 10-20% of patients taking antipsychotics.
Management
To manage cardiovascular effects, healthcare providers may adjust the dosage
or switch to a different antipsychotic medication. In some cases, medications
like beta blockers can be used to improve heart function.
Rare but Serious Side Effects of Antipsychotics
1. Tardive Dyskinesia
Tardive dyskinesia is a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medication
use. It is characterized by involuntary movements of the face, lips, tongue, and
other parts of the body (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC4449441/). These movements can be mild or severe and may include:

• Tongue protrusion or other abnormal tongue movements
• Facial grimacing or other facial expressions
• Abnormal postures or movements of the arms and legs
The exact cause of tardive dyskinesia is not fully understood, but it is believed
to be related to long-term use of antipsychotic medications. The risk of
developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the
dose of medication used (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC4449441/).

• High fever (usually above 102°F)
• Muscle rigidity or stiffness
• Changes in mental status, such as confusion or agitation
• Autonomic instability, such as rapid heart rate or blood pressure changes
NMS is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. If you
experience any of these symptoms while taking antipsychotic medications,
seek medical attention right away (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/

Immune System Suppression
Immune system suppression is a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic
medication use. It can occur in people who have never had immune system
problems before (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449441/).
The symptoms of immune system suppression can include:
Increased risk of infections
People taking antipsychotic medications may be more susceptible to
infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections. This is because the
medication can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to
fight off pathogens.
Weakened immune response
Antipsychotics can also cause a weakened immune response, which can lead
to a range of complications, including:
• Increased risk of infections
• Slow healing of wounds
• Recurring illnesses
If you experience any symptoms of immune system suppression, seek medical
attention right away (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC4449441/).

erectile dysfunction. This is a common side effect of many antipsychotic
medications, and it can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.
Blood Clots
Blood clots are a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medication use.
They can occur in people who have never had a blood clot before (https://

clot can include:
Pain or swelling in the affected area
People with a blood clot may experience pain or swelling in the affected area,
which can be severe and debilitating.
