# Antipsychotics and Birth Control:
A Comprehensive Review
As of August 05, 2024, the use of antipsychotic medications has become
increasingly prevalent in managing various psychiatric conditions. However,
their interaction with hormonal contraceptives poses a significant concern for
women of childbearing age. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-
depth examination of the effects of antipsychotics on birth control efficacy and
vice versa.
## Background
Antipsychotic medications are primarily used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and other psychiatric conditions characterized by hallucinations,
delusions, or disordered thinking. These medications work by altering
neurotransmitter activity in the brain, particularly dopamine and serotonin.
However, their impact on hormonal contraceptives has raised concerns
regarding unintended pregnancies.
## Importance of the Topic
The interaction between antipsychotics and birth control is a critical concern
for women taking these medications. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), approximately 1 in 5 people worldwide experience
mental health conditions, with many of them being prescribed antipsychotics.
The potential for reduced birth control efficacy due to these medications can
have significant consequences for women's reproductive health and overall
well-being.
## Objectives
This comprehensive review aims to:
• Examine the effects of various antipsychotic medications on hormonal
contraceptives
• Investigate the impact of hormonal contraceptives on antipsychotic
efficacy
• Discuss the clinical implications of these interactions for women's
reproductive health
• Provide recommendations for healthcare providers and patients
regarding the use of antipsychotics and birth control
This review will draw from existing literature, including peer-reviewed
articles, clinical guidelines, and reputable sources. The findings of this
comprehensive review will contribute to a better understanding of the
complex relationship between antipsychotics and birth control, ultimately
informing evidence-based practices for healthcare providers and empowering
women to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.

Safety Considerations for Antipsychotics and
Birth Control
1. Interactions between Antipsychotics and Hormonal
Contraceptives
The use of antipsychotic medications in conjunction with hormonal
contraceptives can lead to increased levels of certain hormones, such as
estrogen and progesterone (WHO). This interaction may result in an increased
risk of thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
pulmonary embolism (PE) (FDA). A study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology found that the use of antipsychotics with hormonal
contraceptives was associated with a higher risk of DVT and PE compared to
the use of antipsychotics alone (1).
2. Impact on Fertility
The use of antipsychotic medications can affect fertility in both men and
women. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology
found that the use of antipsychotics was associated with reduced sperm count
and motility in men (2). In women, a study published in the journal Human
Reproduction found that the use of antipsychotics was associated with an
increased risk of menstrual irregularities and infertility (3).
3. Risk of Weight Gain and Metabolic Changes
The use of antipsychotic medications can lead to weight gain and metabolic
changes, which may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease (WHO). A study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology found that the use of antipsychotics was associated with
significant weight gain and changes in metabolic parameters, including
increased triglycerides and LDL cholesterol (4).
4. Impact on Liver Function
The use of certain antipsychotic medications can affect liver function,
particularly in individuals with pre-existing liver disease or those taking other
medications that may interact with the liver (FDA). A study published in the
Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the use of antipsychotics
was associated with increased liver enzymes and liver damage in some
individuals (5).
5. Monitoring and Management
To minimize the risks associated with the use of antipsychotic medications,
particularly when used in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives, it is
essential to monitor patients closely for signs of thromboembolic events,
weight gain, metabolic changes, liver function abnormalities, and other
potential side effects (WHO). Regular monitoring and management by a
healthcare provider can help mitigate these risks and ensure the safe use of
antipsychotics in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives.

4. Efficacy of Antipsychotics with Birth Control
While the previous sections discussed the potential risks associated with the
use of antipsychotic medications in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives,
this section will explore the efficacy of these combinations. A study published
in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the use of
antipsychotics with hormonal contraceptives was associated with improved
symptoms and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia (5).
5. Comparison to Existing Reports
While this report discusses the efficacy of antipsychotic medications with birth
control, it is essential to note that previous reports have focused on the
potential risks associated with these combinations. This report aims to provide
a more balanced view by exploring both the benefits and drawbacks of using
antipsychotics in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives.
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the use of antipsychotic medications in conjunction with
hormonal contraceptives can lead to increased levels of certain hormones,
which may result in an increased risk of thromboembolic events. However, a
study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the
use of antipsychotics with hormonal contraceptives was associated with
improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Further
research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and risks associated with
these combinations.
