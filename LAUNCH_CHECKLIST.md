# Launch Checklist - FlockParser Demo

## Pre-Upload

- [ ] Video is final (76 seconds, shows all timing: 372.76s → 159.79s → 6.04s)
- [ ] Audio is clear and understandable
- [ ] On-screen text is readable (timing numbers, mode labels)
- [ ] No sensitive information visible (API keys, passwords, internal IPs)

## YouTube Upload

- [ ] Create YouTube account (or use existing)
- [ ] Upload video to YouTube
- [ ] Set video to **Unlisted** (not Private - recruiters can view with link)
- [ ] Title: "FlockParser Demo: 6 Minutes → 6 Seconds with Automatic GPU Routing | Distributed Document RAG"
- [ ] Copy description from `YOUTUBE_DESCRIPTION.md`
- [ ] Add thumbnail (screenshot of 6.04s timing is perfect)
- [ ] Add to playlist: "Portfolio Projects" or "Software Engineering"
- [ ] Category: Science & Technology
- [ ] Tags: machinelearning, distributed, gpu, rag, python, ai, opensource
- [ ] Get YouTube video URL

## Update Repository

- [ ] Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` in README.md with actual YouTube video ID
- [ ] Update GitHub repo links if needed (replace `yourusername`)
- [ ] Commit all changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add demo video and production docs"
  git push
  ```

## GitHub Repository Polish

- [ ] Add proper repo description: "Distributed document RAG with GPU-aware load balancing - 60x+ speedup"
- [ ] Add topics/tags: python, distributed-systems, gpu, rag, ollama, chromadb, mcp
- [ ] Pin README.md link to video at top
- [ ] Check that all links work (no 404s)
- [ ] Verify LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md are visible

## Social Media

### LinkedIn Post (Choose One Version)
- [ ] Copy from `LINKEDIN_POST.md` (Version 1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Update [LINK] with YouTube URL
- [ ] Update [GITHUB LINK] with repo URL
- [ ] Post on Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM
- [ ] Monitor comments for first 2 hours
- [ ] Share to relevant groups (Python Developers, ML Engineers, etc.)

### Twitter/X (Optional)
```
Built a distributed RAG system that went 6 minutes → 6 seconds through automatic GPU routing.

The interesting part: adaptive load balancing across heterogeneous hardware - no manual config.

372s → 6.04s (61.7x speedup)
76-second demo: [YOUTUBE LINK]
Open source: [GITHUB LINK]

#python #distributedsystems #machinelearning
```

### Reddit (Optional - Wait 1 Week After LinkedIn)
Post to:
- [ ] r/Python (Showcase Saturday thread)
- [ ] r/machinelearning (wait for feedback first)
- [ ] r/datascience (if well-received elsewhere)

**Format:**
- Title: "[P] Distributed Document RAG with GPU Auto-Routing - 60x+ Speedup"
- Link to GitHub with comment linking to demo video
- **Don't spam** - one subreddit per week

## Portfolio Website (If You Have One)

- [ ] Add project to portfolio page
- [ ] Embed YouTube video
- [ ] Link to GitHub repo
- [ ] Include key stats (372s → 6s)
- [ ] Add "Technical Highlights" section

## Resume Update

Add to projects section:
```
FlockParser - Distributed Document RAG System
• Built intelligent load balancer with GPU auto-detection achieving 60x+ speedup (6min → 6sec)
• Implemented adaptive routing across heterogeneous clusters (CPU/GPU nodes)
• Created 4 interfaces (CLI, Web UI, REST API, MCP) with privacy-tiered architecture
• Tech: Python, Ollama, ChromaDB, FastAPI, MCP protocol
• Open source (MIT) - 76-second demo video available
```

## Job Applications (If Actively Searching)

- [ ] Add GitHub link to applications
- [ ] Reference in cover letters: "Recent project: distributed RAG system with 60x speedup"
- [ ] Prepare to discuss:
  - Why you built it (solve a real problem)
  - Technical decisions (ChromaDB vs X, adaptive routing logic)
  - What you'd improve (PostgreSQL backend, Prometheus metrics)
  - What you learned (distributed systems, load balancing, privacy design)

## Monitoring & Follow-Up

### Week 1
- [ ] Check YouTube analytics (views, watch time, audience retention)
- [ ] Respond to all comments/questions
- [ ] Monitor GitHub stars/forks
- [ ] Track LinkedIn post engagement

### Week 2
- [ ] Add testimonials/feedback to README if any
- [ ] Create issues for suggested improvements
- [ ] Consider writing blog post with deeper technical dive

### Month 1
- [ ] Review what worked (where did traffic come from?)
- [ ] Plan next demo or project iteration
- [ ] Update based on feedback

## Success Metrics

**Good Signs:**
- ✅ Engineers ask technical questions (shows serious interest)
- ✅ Recruiters message you about distributed systems roles
- ✅ GitHub stars/forks from people actually using it
- ✅ Comments like "This is exactly what I needed for X"

**Warning Signs:**
- ❌ Lots of views but no engagement (video isn't clear)
- ❌ People focus on AI/RAG only (missing the systems engineering angle)
- ❌ Questions about basic setup (README unclear)

## Emergency Fixes

If people report issues:
- [ ] Video doesn't play → Re-upload or change privacy settings
- [ ] Links 404 → Update broken links immediately
- [ ] Setup instructions unclear → Add FAQ section to README
- [ ] Security concerns → Address in issue, update docs

## Final Pre-Launch Check

Before hitting "Publish" on anything:

1. **Run through demo yourself** - Does it make sense?
2. **Test all links** - GitHub, YouTube, nothing 404s
3. **Spell check** - README, video description, LinkedIn post
4. **Privacy check** - No credentials, internal IPs, or sensitive data visible
5. **Backup** - Commit everything to Git

**Ready to launch?** Start with YouTube upload, then README update, then LinkedIn (in that order).
